The global financial system is complex, any tiny wobble and it can affect the entire network. In 2008, one mortgage default lead to a global financial crisis, and chaos theory gives us a strong framework to understand it. Lorenz, the mvp of chaos theory, showed how a tiny difference in initial conditions, such as a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil leading to a hurricane in Texas. The Global Financial Crisis was Wall Street's butterfly effect.

The cause was a single mortgage default in the U.S. subprime market. Banks were built on fragile and high leverged structures, like MBS and CDOs (pooling thousands of mortages and slicing them into tranches of different risk, AAA, BBB). These were supposed to distribute risk, but instead they created a system based on fragility. When defaults on subprime loans began, the losses perpetuated through the financial market like perturbations in a non linear system, creating feedback loops that grow exponentially, just like the Lorenz Attractor in chaos theory.

As defaults rose and confidence in MBS and CDOs collapsed. Banks were then unwilling to lend to each other, causing the interbank credit market to freeze.
Lehman Brothers failed in the autumn of 2008, which triggered a chain reaction of bank failures worldwide. The link between banks and shadow banking entities is similar to coupled oscillators in physics, when one element destabilises, the res can amplify the disturbance.

The FED injected liquidity into the economy and imposed emergency lending, other governments worldwide enacted bank bailouts and stimulus packages. These actions are like external forces applied to a chaotic system attempting to stabiliste it. The crisis lead to a global recession, with trillions in wealth gone, increased unemployment and triggered reforms like Dodd-Frank and Basel III.

From a physics perspective, it is curious to see how the GFC can be understood through non linear dynamics. Small perturbations propagated through a highly complex (but weak) network, triggering a systematic transition from stability (bull market) to collapse (bear market). The financial system was stable under small fluctuations but pushed to a different equilibtium by minor shocks.

The GFC was a real world showcase of chaos and complexity.
